## The Challenge

GreenChain aimed to democratize access to carbon credits, but their initial MVP was too technical for non-crypto natives. The complex wallet connection and transaction signing process was causing a 70% drop-off rate at checkout.

## The Solution

We redesigned the platform with a "Web2.5" approach, abstracting away the blockchain complexity:

*   Implemented social login and account abstraction wallets
*   Designed a clean, dashboard-style interface for tracking impact
*   Created educational micro-interactions to explain credit verification

## The Results

The new interface bridged the gap between corporate sustainability officers and decentralized tech:

*   **60% increase** in user retention
*   **3x increase** in corporate partnerships
*   Awarded "Best UX in ReFi" at EthDenver
