## The Challenge

Apex Logistics was losing millions annually due to inventory mismanagement—overstocking perishable goods and understocking high-demand items. Their legacy Excel-based forecasting was manual, slow, and error-prone.

## The Solution

Lumina Digital built a custom predictive analytics dashboard powered by a time-series forecasting model:

*   Ingested 5 years of historical sales and logistics data
*   Integrated external signals like weather patterns and economic indicators
*   Developed a real-time visualization dashboard for warehouse managers

## The Results

The system provided actionable insights that transformed their operations:

*   **20% reduction** in inventory waste
*   **15% reduction** in storage costs
*   Forecast accuracy improved from 65% to 92%
