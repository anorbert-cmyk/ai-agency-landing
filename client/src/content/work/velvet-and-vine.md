## The Challenge

Velvet & Vine, a premier luxury fashion retailer, was struggling with low conversion rates despite high traffic. Their static product recommendations weren't resonating with their sophisticated clientele, who expected a personalized shopping experience comparable to an in-store visit.

## The Solution

Lumina Digital engineered a bespoke AI recommendation engine tailored to the nuances of high fashion. Unlike generic plugins, our model analyzed:

*   Visual similarity of garments (cut, fabric, pattern)
*   User browsing behavior and dwell time
*   Historical purchase data segmented by seasonal trends

We integrated this engine seamlessly into their existing headless commerce stack, ensuring sub-100ms response times.

## The Results

Within three months of deployment, the results were transformative:

*   **45% increase** in conversion rate
*   **35% increase** in Average Order Value (AOV)
*   **20% reduction** in return rates due to better sizing recommendations
