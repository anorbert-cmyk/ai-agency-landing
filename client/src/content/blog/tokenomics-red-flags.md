Not all tokens are created equal. Before you invest or build, check for these structural weaknesses.

## 1. High Insider Allocation

If the team and VCs control >40% of the supply with short vesting schedules, you are the exit liquidity.

## 2. Inflationary Rewards without Revenue

Paying out 100% APY in a native token is easy. Sustaining value when everyone sells that reward is impossible without real protocol revenue.

## 3. Lack of Sink Mechanisms

Tokens need a reason to be taken out of circulation. Whether it's buybacks, burning, or locking for utility, a sinkless token is destined for zero.
